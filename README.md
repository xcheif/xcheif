## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
About
this is a file sharing program for windows 11 must have python installed prefferably from microsoft store first download file save it to a directory note it down then make a folder in the same directory as the file and name it "shared_files" then open properties click advanced sharing ->tick share folder-> click permisions-> full control then save. now for the last step you may have these things already installed depending on how much you use python but this will be nessacary 
# Install Python (if not already installed)
# Download Python from https://www.python.org/ and install it.

# Check Python version (ensure it's installed)
python --version

# Install tkinter (if needed, though itâ€™s usually pre-installed with Python)
pip install tk

# Check pip version (ensure pip is installed)
pip --version

# Ensure pip is up-to-date
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

now to open there are a few ways such as opening the file directly if you are lucky and you ave the right settings this may work but the universal method would be open cmd type these commands

"cd /path/to/your/scriptsdirectory/" dont use the quotation marks the directory is the location of your file like say you saved it to desktop just get the path to desktop then there you go next->

"python filehapion.py" or "py filehaion.py" this should open it 

next you are going to want to move the files you want to share into the filesharing file then in the program click share in the command prompt open it should give you a code (btw this has to be done on a local network) the other person on there computer with the program enter the code it gives you then click connect and it should show you all available files then click downloads it will save into the desktop hopefully like i said if there are issues and error codes ask chatgpt
